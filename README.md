# Diversity-and-Inclusion


## Project Objective


This project aims to support our telecom client in improving gender balance within their executive management by identifying key performance indicators related to hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover. These KPIs will offer valuable insights into the company's gender dynamics, enabling a data-driven approach to address existing imbalances. By examining metrics such as the percentage of women hired, promoted, and their average performance ratings, we seek to identify the underlying causes of slow progress in achieving gender diversity at the executive level.
