# Diversity-and-Inclusion


## Project Objective


This dashboard aims to support our telecom client in improving gender balance within their executive management by identifying key performance indicators related to hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover. These KPIs will offer valuable insights into the company's gender dynamics, enabling a data-driven approach to address existing imbalances. By examining metrics such as the percentage of women hired, promoted, and their average performance ratings, we seek to identify the underlying causes of slow progress in achieving gender diversity at the executive level.

## project Insights 



Upon analyzing the KPI data for hires across various job levels, the following gender distribution was observed:


- Junior Officer Level: 63% female hires and 37% male hires.
- Manager Level: 60% female hires and 40% male hires.
- Senior Manager Level: 30% female hires and 70% male hires.
- Director Level: 25% female hires and 75% male hires.
- Executive Level: 100% male hires.

  
This data indicates a significant gender disparity, with a higher proportion of female hires at junior and manager levels, and a predominance of male hires at senior manager, director, and executive levels. Notably, the executive level comprises entirely male hires, highlighting a critical area for intervention to promote gender diversity at the top management tier.

A column chart was used to represent hires across various job levels.
