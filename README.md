# Diversity-and-Inclusion


## Project Objective


This dashboard aims to support our telecom client in improving gender balance within their executive management by identifying key performance indicators related to hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover. These KPIs will offer valuable insights into the company's gender dynamics, enabling a data-driven approach to address existing imbalances. By examining metrics such as the percentage of women hired, promoted, and their average performance ratings, we seek to identify the underlying causes of slow progress in achieving gender diversity at the executive level.

- Merged all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicers to make it dynamic.
- Navigated to the "Model" view to establish relationships between different tables.
- Used DAX to create calculated measures for KPIs such as gender distribution, promotion rates, and turnover rates.
- Visual filters (Slicers) were added for four fields named "Department", "Age group", "Job Level" & "Region group".

## project Insights 

### 1. Hiring


Upon analyzing the KPI data for hires across various job levels, the following gender distribution was observed:


- Junior Officer Level: 63% female hires and 37% male hires.
- Manager Level: 60% female hires and 40% male hires.
- Senior Manager Level: 30% female hires and 70% male hires.
- Director Level: 25% female hires and 75% male hires.
- Executive Level: 100% male hires.

  
This data indicates a significant gender disparity, with a higher proportion of female hires at junior and manager levels, and a predominance of male hires at senior manager, director, and executive levels. Notably, the executive level comprises entirely male hires, highlighting a critical area for intervention to promote gender diversity at the top management tier.

A column chart was used to represent hires across various job levels.

### 2. Promotions


Upon analyzing the promotion data visualized through a line and clustered column chart, the following gender distribution across job levels after fiscal year 2021 promotions was observed:

- Junior Officer Level: 91 female employees and 78 male employees.
- Senior Officer Level: 50 female employees and 46 male employees.
- Manager Level: 25 female employees and 54 male employees.
- Senior Manager Level: 11 female employees and 46 male employees.
- Director Level: 4 female employees and 29 male employees.
- Executive Level: 3 female employees and 16 male employees.
  
The line plot further revealed the following promotion rates for female employees:

22% promoted to Senior Officer.

8% promoted to Manager.

27.27% promoted to Senior Manager.

25% promoted to Director.

33.33% promoted to Executive.

These findings indicate a gender disparity in both the distribution of employees across job levels and the promotion rates to higher positions. Notably, the proportion of female employees decreases as the job level increases, with a significant underrepresentation at the Senior Manager, Director, and Executive levels. Additionally, the promotion rates for female employees vary across levels, suggesting potential areas for improvement in promoting gender equity within the organization.

Upon analyzing the average tenure data visualized through a clustered bar chart, the findings indicate that, in most job levels, male employees have a slightly longer average tenure compared to their female counterparts. Notably, at the Senior Manager level, male employees have a tenure of 2.3 years, which is 0.5 years longer than the 1.8 years observed for female employees.
